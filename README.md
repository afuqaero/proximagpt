# proximagpt

This is my first repo in GitHub and my first project. It was published on 19/1/2023. Started this project because I was so passionate about ChatGPT and was thinking
about making one of my own. And maybe monetize it and provide to local people of it's use as ChatGPT is planning to make a paid subscription soon and i expect
it will be more expensive. I am also trying to learn how to develop and run a machine learning model despite having no prior experience on ML AI, and with little codding
experience.
